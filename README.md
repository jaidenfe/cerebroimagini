# cerebroimagini
A non-invasive functional near-infrared brain mapping device created from scratch. This project includes custom hardware as well as a desktop application to operate the fNIR device. Applications for this project are neroscience research, computer interfaces, and many other brain-related fields. THIS PROJECT IS STILL IN ITS INITIAL PHASE AND IS NOT FUNCTIONAL AS OF YET.
